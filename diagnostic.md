1.  Suppose you have a nested route at the URL `/campus/boston`. How would you

    ```

1.  Explain **at least** two differences between the following two route
    definitions.

    ```js

    ```

1.  Suppose we have the following route definition:

    ```js
    this.route('movie', { path: '/movies/:movie_id' }); // <= ðŸ‘€ here
    ```

    If we navigate in the browser to `/movies/123`, how can we reference the
    value `'123'` inside a Route?

    ```md
    I do not know how to answer this one. Please advise as well.
